# selection-sort-visualize
This is a project to display all the steps of the **Selection Sort** 📈 Algorithm,It can be useful as a project for school or college 🏦.

Written by `Python` 🐍 and the `Tkinter` module.
## Requirement 📦
As a requirement: you only need to install the tkinter module by :

```pip install tk```

Or other ways that depend on your operating system.
## How it work 💡
The program follows the algorithm 📄 and the selection sort algorithm works as follows 📉 :

The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right. 

- ♈ Red is current minimum.
- ♌ Yellow is sorted list. 
- ⛎ Blue is current item.
